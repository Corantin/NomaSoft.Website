# Terms of Service

By collaborating with NomaSoft you agree to transparent communication, scoped delivery,
and professional conduct.

## Engagement

Projects begin with a discovery workshop to confirm deliverables, responsibilities, and
success metrics. Work is billed according to the proposal or ongoing retainer schedule.

## Responsibilities

NomaSoft provides experienced engineers focused on quality and security. Clients supply
timely feedback, required assets, and ensure authorised decision makers are available.

## Payments

Invoices are due within 14 days unless otherwise noted. Late payments may pause delivery
until the account is current.

## Liability

We deliver work on a best-effort basis. Except where prohibited by law, NomaSoft's
liability is limited to fees paid for the relevant engagement phase.
